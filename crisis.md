# When the Market Bleeds, Do We Go Green or Go Home?

Alright, listen up. Making bank is priority number one, obviously. But lately, our Patagonia vests have been feeling a little... guilty. So we built this killer ESG portfolio to see if we could crush our quarterly goals *and* sleep at night.

The big question: when the world goes sideways and the market tanks, does our "feel-good" portfolio actually protect our capital, or do we get wrecked? We put it to the test against the old-school, no-regrets Non-ESG portfolio across the biggest meltdowns of the last few years. Let's see who cried less.

## The Vibe Check: Daily Mood Swings

First, a quick look at the daily drama. This boxplot shows the distribution of returns for every single day during the crises. It's the best way to see who was having wilder panic attacks.

**(Your boxplot image goes here, legend.)**

You can see the spread, the median, and the outliers. Basically, were the ESG boys more zen, or just as emotional as the rest of the market?

## The Big Picture: Where the Money Ran to Hide (Aggregated Sankeys)

We threw every crisis into a blender to get the 30,000-foot view. These Sankey diagrams show where the capital flowed—from which sectors into which buckets of pain or gain. This is the ultimate "who survived?" chart.

### Non-ESG Portfolio: The "Old School" Flow
*How the traditional, profit-at-all-costs portfolio held up.*

**The takeaway?** Compare them side-by-side. Did our ESG bets in sectors like "Energy & Utilities" (think clean energy) hold up better than the grimy oil plays in the Non-ESG fund? This is where we spot the macro trends.

## A Trip Down Crisis Lane: Round-by-Round Analysis

Now, let's zoom in. How did our portfolios react to each specific market apocalypse?

### Round 1: The COVID-19 Panic Room (2020)
Remember when the world shut down? Total chaos. Here’s the play-by-play of our portfolios' cumulative returns. Did ESG provide a safe harbor or did everything sink together?

### Round 2: Russia Goes Rogue (2022)

### Round 4: The Great Tariff Scare of '25 (Our Crystal Ball)

## The Bottom Line

So, did the ESG experiment pay off when it mattered most?

Looking at the data, it seems our ESG portfolio was like having a slightly better helmet. It didn't make us invincible—a market, wide crash is still a crash, but it consistently took fewer direct hits. The drawdowns were often shallower and the recovery a bit steadier.

You might not get the same face-ripping rallies as some high-risk legacy sectors, but you also might not lose your shirt when things go sideways. And you get to tell people you're saving the world. For a finance bro, that's what we call a win-win.
